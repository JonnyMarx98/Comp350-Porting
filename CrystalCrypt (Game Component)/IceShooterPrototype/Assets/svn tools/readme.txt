Thank you for purchasing Svn Tools!

Please open the Version Control settings after you have imported Svn Tools into your project (Edit/Project Settings/Version Control).
In this window you can setup your project for version control.

Svn Tools requires a few third party tools in order to work properly, 
these can be downloaded from inside your Version Control settings window or with the following links:

TortoiseSVN: https://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html
SlikSVN (Subversion client): https://sliksvn.com/download/
Other Subversion packages (optional, to replace SlikSVN): https://subversion.apache.org/packages.html

If you want more control over what Svn Tools does then you can change your preferences in the Preferences Window:
Edit/Preferences.../Svn Tools

For a step by step guide on how to setup Svn Tools and your project, please view the online documentation:
